Simple and easy-to-use library for implementing application servers.

Simple HTTP server
  To be used behind reverse proxying master (such as nginx or lighttpd). Just basic
  functions necessary for interacting with HTTP/1.1 clients. Multi-threaded, able
  to serve on multiple ports for multiple applications. Cookie-based sessions included.

Native database access
  ZODB is used as main persistent storage (file and relational backends are supported).
  It is also possible to access relational databases (just MySQL right now), though these
  are not intended as persistent storage.

Object-tree of handlers
  Direct mapping of requested URLs to objects and their methods, starting from single root.
  Method get arguments passed by user as HTTP input, and their return values are send back
  to client as content of HTTP reply.

JSON API
  Support for low-cost methods for exchange of structured data with client.

Events
  Simple as title says, a lot of events can be defined and acted on their arrival.

And some other simple features to ease my life :)
  Input validation - see FormEncode for preview
  Logging framework, for access and error logs, with few different targets (stderr, file, ...)
  User authentication, based on sessions
  HTTP output compression
  Simple text formatting, as known from phpBB forums
  Generic object cache
  Localization, as easy to use as gettext
  Easy-to-use internal statistic counters (with presentation)

Includes simple HTTP webserver (to be used behind reverse proxy), user
authentication, caching, events, input validation,

Built using:
- Python (http://www.python.org/) for core functionality.
- ZODB (http://www.zodb.org/) as main persistent storage.
- Mako Templates (http://www.makotemplates.org) are used for generating HTML responses.
- FormEncode (http://www.formencode.org/en/latest/index.html) as base for input validation.
- jQuery (www.jquery.com) and CoffeeScript (http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) are used for client-side scripting.
- Formee (http://formee.org) as CSS framework for HTML forms.
